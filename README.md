# Tic Tac Toe
Play a game of Tic Tac Toe against the computer.

Demo link: [https://bethqiang.github.io/tic-tac-toe](https://bethqiang.github.io/tic-tac-toe)

Built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and JQuery.

Current functionalities include:
* Very, very hard to beat AI--if not unbeatable? (Still in testing.)
* Choose to play as X or O.
* Start a new game after the current game is finished.

Future ideas include:
* Have the Xs and Os on the board be different colors.
* Implement Minimax algorithm for AI logic.
